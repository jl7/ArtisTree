ArtisTree README by SuperWomen

We used JQuery, store.js, Bootstrap, d3, and Handlebars as external libraries for our application, and adapted https://github.com/fsahin/artist-explorer/blob/master/js/dndTree.js to implement our library d3Tree.js for ArtisTree’s tree functionality. ArtistTree was implemented with Sublime Text 3 and tested with Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on MacBooks.

Issue: 
- Help popup does not work on Firefox.

Requirements: 
- Spotify application must be downloaded onto the desktop 
- The user must be logged into to a Spotify account 

To run the application, click on index.html.
