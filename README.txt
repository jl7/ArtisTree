We used JQuery, store.js, Bootstrap, d3, and Handlebars as external libraries for our application, and adapted https://github.com/fsahin/artist-explorer/blob/master/js/dndTree.js to implement our library d3Tree.js for ArtisTree’s tree functionality. ArtistTree was implemented with Sublime Text 3 and tested with Google Chrome. All on MacBooks.
